Skills developed at C Piscine

# Shell
	The first two days of the Piscine are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

# C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
