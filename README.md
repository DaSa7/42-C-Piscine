Skills developed at C Piscine

# Shell
	The first two days of the Piscine are about learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to know how to navigate through the terminal.

# C Language
	The primary language learned at the Piscine is C: variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
